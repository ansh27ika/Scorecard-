## Overview
As per the research and analysis With the advent and advancement of technology, data is rapidly becoming one of the driving forces behind global economy. Every enterprise deal with a lot of data, which magnifies the difficulties of seeking information which is most relevant to their problems. Hence, it seems that the institutions make a mistake of wasting time measuring too many things. The increasing amount of data and the need for daily monitoring and evaluation lead to the development of management applications with graphical data analysis known as Dashboards, which is a tool that allows the alignment of business processes and strategies implementation.

Programming/Working Environment:
We  used python programming language for pre-procesing as we downloaded the data in the numerical format and converted to categorical format , and for visualization used Tableau  as it offers drag-and-drop functionalities for building charts and dashboards.

Requirements to run the application:

The Dashboard created in this project was conducted with Tableau Public. Tableau Public enables interactive data visualization and focuses on business intelligence
We have used real world fake dataset to draw information and create dashboard accordingly. It contains  Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation Dataset 
The data was collected from the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Educational Sciences students in 2019. The purpose is to predict students' end-of-term performances. 

## Dataset

* Data Set Characteristics:  	Multivariate	Number of Instances:	145	Area:	Social
* Attribute Characteristics:	Integer	Number of Attributes:	30	Date Donated	2021-01-30

•	Flip-classroom: ( not useful, useful ,not applicable)
•	Cumulative grade point average in the last semester 
•	Expected Cumulative grade point average in the graduation 
•	Course ID

## Descriptive Statistics Using Tableau

The substage of data understanding is summarizing the attributes of the data in the form of visuals and graphs which could give a quick reference to its pattern of distribution. Using the visual way is advantageous in understanding the data, patterns, trend and overall distribution for the dataset.

## Sports activity 

Participating in athletics has been known to improve the cognitive and memory functions of the brain, helping kids perform better in tests and academics . Further, traits such as discipline and perseverance also play an important part in better academic performance.
So As per Research and Analysis there is count of 58 sports activity from age 18 to above 26 are  females who take participate in sports on the other side with the count of 78 sports activity from age 18 to above 26 are males who take participate in sports. 
Out of discrimination of males and females the question arisises how many people say yes to sports from age 18 to above 26 only 58 students who says yes to sports wheather it’s a male or female but according to our stats there are 87 students who says no to sports so on the conclusion we get to know that we need to motivate students to take more interst in sports for increasing focus and better academic results.

## Attendance sheet

Researchers have found a strong correlation between attendance for school and academic performance and success. Children that miss school frequently often fall behind— both academically as well as professionally. Absence from school is often the biggest single cause of poor performance and achievement. Talking about statistics Figure shows how many people attends the class always or sometime from the age 18 to 25 65 students attends the conference and seminars in which 51 students attends daily and 14 students attend sometimes but from age above 26 very few people give importance to attend classes.

## LISTENING AND READING FREQUENCIES 

This  study aims to investigate the effects of listening and reading  during the class
So according to our statistics  from the age 18 to 25 count of students listening in class increase by count of 5 but when it comes to the  age above 26 there are very few people who are active in class. Whereas if we talk about reading frequencies wheather its scientific or non-scientific the people who are listening they are also active when it comes to reading in the class so from age age 18 to 21 there are 65 students who  focuses on reading and from age 22 to 25 `70 STUDENTS are interested but the only 10 students from age above 26 who gives focus on reading.

## Conclusion:
This analysis has taught us that, factors such as parental level of education, socioeconomic disadvantage, test preparation courses affect the students’ performances in the exams. But there are many exceptions as well. There are students with a low parental level of education scoring full marks. Also, some students have not completed the test preparation course getting full marks. These students may have their own strategies for test preparations. Socioeconomic disadvantage also has many exceptions. These students did not allow economic obstacles to affect their efforts. So, many factors are affecting the students’ performances. Some have great effects while some not. Also, there are other factors to be considered as well which are not mentioned in the dataset. Factors such as facilities at school, the quality and methods of teaching, peer pressures, hours spent studying, diets, sleeping patterns etc. Such factors also affect the performance of the students.

## Future Scope:

This project was initiated in order to better understand the data of Higher Education Students Performance  and how does the institute respond to student  queries and complaints. The dashboard can easily be updated with new data. This project has been made to suggest and develop some tools, which could be useful to the institute. The findings obtained from the dashboard can help improve institutional  services and experiences, thereby strengthening the relationship between the educational institution and it's students . The theory and understanding obtained from the project can be applied to different data representing different educational institutions.
