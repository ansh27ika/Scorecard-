## Overview
As per the research and analysis With the advent and advancement of technology, data is rapidly becoming one of the driving forces behind global economy. Every enterprise deal with a lot of data, which magnifies the difficulties of seeking information which is most relevant to their problems. Hence, it seems that the institutions make a mistake of wasting time measuring too many things. The increasing amount of data and the need for daily monitoring and evaluation lead to the development of management applications with graphical data analysis known as Dashboards, which is a tool that allows the alignment of business processes and strategies implementation.

Programming/Working Environment:
We  used python programming language for pre-procesing as we downloaded the data in the numerical format and converted to categorical format , and for visualization used Tableau  as it offers drag-and-drop functionalities for building charts and dashboards.

Requirements to run the application:

The Dashboard created in this project was conducted with Tableau Public. Tableau Public enables interactive data visualization and focuses on business intelligence
We have used real world fake dataset to draw information and create dashboard accordingly. It contains  Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation Dataset 
The data was collected from the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Educational Sciences students in 2019. The purpose is to predict students' end-of-term performances.

Researchers have found a strong correlation between attendance for school and academic performance and success. Children that miss school frequently often fall behind— both academically as well as professionally. Absence from school is often the biggest single cause of poor performance and achievement. Talking about statistics Figure shows how many people attends the class always or sometime from the age 18 to 25 65 students attends the conference and seminars in which 51 students attends daily and 14 students attend sometimes but from age above 26 very few people give importance to attend classes
